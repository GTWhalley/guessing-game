Basic guessing game exercise

HTML and CSS provided in the course files, JS written by me with the guidance of course lecture (attempting to write it first myself, verify accuracy by watching lecture).

This is a basic number guessing game that checks for user input and compares it against a randomly generated number between 1 and 20. Elements on the screen will change based on the situation, ie. guessing too high or too low will give different notifications, losing or winning the game will change some CSS elements, the user's high score is tracked and carried over to a new game, etc.
